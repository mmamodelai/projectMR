## **⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES:**

### **Windows Defender Warning**

When Spain first runs `SMSConductor.exe`, Windows Defender might show:

```
Windows protected your PC
Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting.
```

**This is NORMAL with PyInstaller!**

**Tell them to:**
1. Click "More info"
2. Click "Run anyway"

**Why this happens:**
- PyInstaller packages Python code into EXE
- Windows doesn't recognize it as "known" software
- It's 100% safe (it's your code!)

### **Firewall Prompt**

They might see:

```
Windows Defender Firewall has blocked some features of this app.
```

**Tell them to:**
- Click "Allow access" (for private networks)
- This lets it connect to Supabase
