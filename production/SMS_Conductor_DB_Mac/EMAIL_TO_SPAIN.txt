Subject: SMS Conductor Beta v1.0 - Ready to Use! 🚀

Hey [Partner Name],

The SMS Conductor is ready! This is the beta release (v1.0) - fully functional and tested.

=== WHAT IT DOES ===

✅ View all customer messages in real-time
✅ Reply to customers manually
✅ Approve AI-generated campaign messages
✅ Schedule campaigns (type a number, click Schedule)
✅ See the full campaign pipeline (who's scheduled, sent, etc.)
✅ Mark conversations as read (right-click)
✅ Live Mode - auto-refresh every 15 seconds

=== QUICK START ===

1. INSTALL PYTHON 3.8+
   Download: https://www.python.org/downloads/
   ✅ Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation

2. INSTALL DEPENDENCIES
   Open Command Prompt and run these two lines:
   
   cd [folder where you saved the file]
   pip install supabase python-dateutil

3. RUN THE APP
   Double-click: START_SMS_VIEWER.bat
   
   OR double-click: SMSconductor_DB.py

4. DONE!
   The SMS Conductor window opens.
   Everything is already connected to our database.

=== HOW IT WORKS ===

You: View messages, approve campaigns, schedule sends
My computer (California): Actually sends the SMS messages
Database (Supabase): Keeps everything in sync

No modem needed on your end! Everything happens in real-time.

=== KEY FEATURES ===

📱 REPLY TAB: Click a conversation, type your reply, send
📝 FIRST TEXTS: Approve AI messages for first contacts
🎯 CAMPAIGN MASTER: See everything (yellow=needs approval, blue=approved, green=scheduled/sent)
📅 SCHEDULE: Type "10" and click Schedule to queue 10 messages
☑️ LIVE MODE: Check the box (top-right) for auto-refresh

=== TIPS ===
