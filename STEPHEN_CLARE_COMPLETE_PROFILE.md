## 🚨 REVISED CHURN ANALYSIS

### Why He Left (Now with Evidence):

1. **Price**: 
   - Spent $87.74 first visit
   - Declined to $8.53 by third visit
   - Probably found cheaper alternatives

2. **Product Availability**:
   - Bought specific brands (Stiiizy, Froot Gummies)
   - If they ran out of stock, he'd go elsewhere

3. **Competition**:
   - Santee, CA has multiple dispensaries
   - Easy to price-shop

4. **Limited Relationship**:
   - Worked with 2 different budtenders
   - No strong personal connection
   - No email to stay engaged

## 💡 ACTIONABLE WIN-BACK STRATEGY
