## RECOMMENDED APPROACH

**Quick Win (Phase 1 only)**:
- Scrape top 7 strains
- Add 3,715 products
- Get to 24% coverage
- Time: ~1 hour

**Maximum Impact (All 3 phases)**:
- Scrape all 24 strains
- Add 5,179 products
- Get to 27.7% coverage
- Time: ~2-3 hours

## HOW TO EXECUTE

1. Create strain list file:
   ```
   OG Kush
   Blue Dream
   Cookies
   Sour Diesel
   ... (etc)
   ```

2. Run batch scraper:
   ```bash
   cd leafly
   python leafly_scraper.py --batch expansion_strains.txt --output expansion_data.json
   ```

3. Run import to Supabase:
   ```bash
   cd supabase-integration
   python import_leafly_to_supabase.py
   ```

## NOTES

- OG Kush will match many variants (Fire OG, Skywalker OG, etc.)
- Cookies will match GSC, Thin Mint, etc.
- Some overlap possible but worth it for coverage
- All these strains are on Leafly (very popular)
