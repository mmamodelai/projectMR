    "sativa_indica_difference": "Great question! While the traditional sativa/indica categories are helpful, the real difference comes down to terpenes - the aromatic compounds that create the effects. Sativa-dominant strains typically have limonene and α-pinene, which create uplifting, energizing effects - perfect for daytime use, creativity, and social situations. Indica-dominant strains usually have myrcene and linalool, which provide relaxing, sedating effects - ideal for evening use, pain relief, and sleep. Most modern strains are actually hybrids with balanced effects. Would you like me to recommend something based on the experience you're looking for?",
    
    "dosing_guidance": "I always recommend starting low and going slow. For beginners: Edibles: Start with 5-10mg THC, wait 2 hours before taking more. Flower: 1-2 small inhalations, wait 15 minutes. Concentrates: Very small amount, wait 10-15 minutes. Your ideal dose depends on your experience, body chemistry, and desired effects. Would you like me to suggest a starting point based on what you're looking for?",
    
    "strongest_product": "I understand you're looking for potency, but the 'strongest' isn't always the best choice. Instead, let's find the most effective product for your specific needs. Higher THC doesn't always mean better effects - terpenes and other cannabinoids play a huge role. A 20% THC product with the right terpene profile might be more effective than a 30% THC product with the wrong profile. What kind of experience are you hoping for? That will help me recommend the most effective product for you.",
    
    "medical_conditions": "Absolutely! We have several options that can help with [condition]. For [condition], I'd recommend products with [specific terpenes/cannabinoids]: [Product 1]: High in [terpene], which is known for [specific benefit]. [Product 2]: [THC/CBD ratio] blend that's great for [condition]. [Product 3]: [Product type] that provides [specific relief]. Are you looking for something for immediate relief or longer-lasting effects? And do you have a preference for how you'd like to consume it?"

    "product_limits": "I want to make sure you're aware of the daily purchase limits: Recreational customers: 28.5g of flower, 8g of concentrates, and 6 clones per day.

We also have a satisfaction guarantee - if this doesn't work for you, we can help you find something that does. Many customers find that trying a few different products helps them discover what works best for their unique needs. Would you like to start with a smaller amount to test it out?",

I'd recommend starting with something gentle and low-dose. [Product recommendation] is perfect for beginners because [specific reasons]. The key is to start with a very small amount and go slowly - you can always take more, but you can't take less. I'm here to guide you through the entire process.
