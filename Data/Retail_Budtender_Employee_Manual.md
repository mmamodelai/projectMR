### 1 Budtender / Retail Training Manual: (updated March 2 0 2 2)


### Purpose: The purpose of this manual is to inform new employees of Mota as to the requirements of

their job and the workplace policies at MOTA.
I. Policies:

### Employee Health and Safety


### As your employer, Mota is concerned with your health and safety. As a Mota employee, your health

and safety in the workplace is protected by Federal, State and County regulations and policies. The
policies discussed here apply to all Mota employees. The State of California administers its own
workplace safety and health program,  called Cal/OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Act), which is
designed to protect  employee’s safety while on the job.
Protecting your health and safety on the job and complying with safety regulations is a two-part
responsibility. Mota, as your employer, has some responsibilities, and you, as an employee, have
some responsibilities. The goal is that everyone works together to maintain a safe workplace. Mota’s
policies, which comply with Cal/OSHA requirements for employers, set out its responsibilities:
- Maintain a workplace that is safe and healthful for the employees.
- Comply with workplace health and safety standards, provide an Injury and Illness Prevention
Program and records, and do not discriminate against employees who report hazardous
working conditions.
- Require each department in the County to have its own Injury and Illness Prevention Program
and to train employees on its provisions. Employers must also provide employees with
training in general safe work practices and specific training concerning hazards unique to any
job assignment.
As an employee, you have a part to play to help maintain a healthy and safe work environment as
well. Your responsibilities under the law require that you:
- Obey all workplace safety and health laws, standards, orders, and regulations.
- Use protective equipment, safety devices, methods or processes intended for employee
protection.
- Do not interfere with the use of safeguards by others.
- Do not remove, displace, damage, destroy or tamper with safety devices, safeguards, notices
or warnings.
If you see an unsafe condition or a problem, you should immediately alert your supervisor or the

### Safety Officer and provide as much information as possible.

### 2 Workplace Violence Policy

Mota is committed to doing everything reasonably necessary to protect the life, safety, and health of
its employees. To enhance the security of our work environment, you must wear your Mota

### Identification Card whenever you are on Mota property. Mota has a zero tolerance policy on threats

or violence in the workplace. Workplace threats, intimidation and violence are expressly prohibited
and could result in termination or other disciplinary action.

### How to Report Violence or a Threat

If you are threatened or witness a threat and you believe there is immediate danger, call 9 1 1 to get
emergency assistance. If you do not feel there is immediate danger, notify your supervisor or
manager, who will report the incident to the departmental personnel/human resources office and
the Office of Security Management. The County’s Office of Security Management is staffed by

### Sheriff’s Department personnel. They review reported security incidents and consult with

departments on handling problems and preventing escalation of reported incidents. If you are
confronted by someone who has become violent or is behaving in a threatening manner, follow
these tips:
- Don’t be a hero.
- Don’t confront anyone who has brought a weapon to work.
- Don’t try to negotiate with a violent person.
- Call 9 1 1 immediately.

### Consequences of Violating the Workplace Violence Policy

Threats of harm are illegal, and anyone who makes a threat in the workplace may be subject to arrest
and prosecution. An employee who makes a threat and is deemed to be a possible danger may be
removed from the workplace while an investigation is conducted. Depending on the circumstances,
the employee may be temporarily transferred to another worksite or suspended.
When it has been determined that a threat or act of violence has been committed, the employee is
subject to departmental discipline, up to and including discharge. If you have questions regarding this
policy, talk with your supervisor or your departmental personnel/human resources office.

### Drug Free Workplace Policy

Mota has a dual responsibility – provide a safe, healthful workplace for its employees and protect the
safety and health of the public. So, a Mota employee under the influence of illegal drugs creates a

## Page 3

MOTA Inc. Budtender / Retail Employee Manual 0 3/2 0 2 2 1 0 A
3 potentially dangerous situation not just for other Mota employees but for the public as well. To help
prevent such a situation from occurring, Mota established a Drug Free Workplace Policy. The policy
states that:
- The abuse of drugs, including alcohol, by employees or contract personnel is unacceptable
because it adversely affects health, safety, security and productivity as well as public
confidence and trust.
- Using, possessing, selling or being under the influence of illegal drugs is unlawful, dangerous
and is absolutely prohibited at the workplace.
- The use of alcohol at the workplace or the misuse of alcohol or prescribed drugs to any extent
that impairs safe and effective job performance is also prohibited.
- Violation of any element of this policy shall result in disciplinary action up to and including
termination.

### Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO)/Non-Discrimination Policy


### State and Federal laws have established that no one shall be discriminated against or harassed in

employment because of:
- Race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental disability,
medical condition, marital status, age, sex or sexual orientation.

### If you have questions, please contact your supervisor or the Compliance Officer.

ADA Compliance Program
This program assures that people with disabilities are given equal opportunity in compliance with the
‘Americans With Disabilities Act’ (ADA). Mota’s ADA Compliance Program states that:
Mota does not discriminate on the basis of disability in employment or in providing access to cannabis
products. This policy applies equally to employees of Mota and members of the general public who
access cannabis products through Mota.

### If you have questions regarding this program, contact your supervisor or the Compliance Officer.


### Diversity Policy/Cultural Awareness


### Because it supports an inclusive, diverse workplace and cultural awareness, the Mota established a


### Diversity Policy, which states that:


## Page 4

MOTA Inc. Budtender / Retail Employee Manual 0 3/2 0 2 2 1 0 A

### 4 It is the policy of Mota to create an inclusive workplace environment in which each person is valued

for his/her unique gifts and talents; to capitalize on the innovation inherent in diverse work groups;
and to assure that each person is valued based on individual characteristics rather than on
stereotypes.
A key goal of this policy is to conduct employee training for the purpose of instructing participants to
respect others and be open to their individual experiences; generating an awareness of other’s
personal perceptions by imparting knowledge of cultural characteristics; and teaching skills to apply
cultural concepts in everyday working behaviors.

### Performance Review Policy

Probation

### You must serve a 9 0-Day Probationary Period when you are first hired and each time you are

promoted to a higher level position. You do not become a permanent employee until you have
successfully completed your first probation. To manage your performance and make the best of your
probationary period, get a clear understanding of what is expected of you from your supervisor. The
probationary period is the time to show your department that they made the right decision. You
must show that you can perform the duties of the job without a need for close supervision and
monitoring. You must take the initiative to understand policies, regulations, and instructions. You are
required to deliver quality services. Most importantly, you must work and conduct yourself in a
professional manner that is appropriate for your job and that exemplifies the values of the Mota
Vision.
It is important to know that your performance is formally evaluated at the end of your probationary
period and annually after that.  Mota, may, at its sole discretion, conduct mor frequent formal
reviews of workplace performance. If you do not meet performance requirements and expectations,
or your behavior is unacceptable, you may be released if you are a first-time probationer. If you are
serving a promotional probation, and your performance does not meet expectations, you may be
discharged or reduced.

### Your probationary period is the final step in the selection process. Generally, there are only two

rating choices at the end of probation – Competent or Unsatisfactory . There are three ratings
possible for participants in the Management Appraisal and Performance Plan – Exceptional, Merit or
Unsatisfactory . An Unsatisfactory rating constitutes failure of probation and results in reduction or
release from service. Mota probationary periods can last anywhere from one to six months
depending on the position you hold. Most probationary periods are three months. If you are not sure
about the length of your probation, ask your supervisor.

### 5 Performance Evaluation System

As a Mota employee, it is extremely important that your work is evaluated. During the course of your
employment, you may receive both informal and formal performance reviews. Evaluations let you
know how you’re doing and give you guidance on how to do your job even better. Your supervisor
will discuss your performance evaluation report with you and provide you with a copy. Some
temporary employees may also receive performance evaluation reports.

### Attendance/Tardiness

You are expected to report to work each day, and arrive on time in accordance with your work
schedule. At Mota, we use ‘When I Work’ to publish team member shift times. You are required to
notify your supervisor if you’re going to be late or absent. You must follow your work schedule,
including observing your lunch and break times. Mota may adjust the start times for lunches and
break times for production efficiency. Your supervisor will explain the attendance requirements for
your work area.

### Requesting Leave Time

Even though you may have earned time off, you must get authorization to use it. Request time off, in
advance, through your supervisor or someone identified by your supervisor to contact in the
supervisor’s absence. Make sure you have approval before taking time off from work. Always follow
the procedures and instructions for your work area.

7 a.Folder ID: All batches of product will have a folder number assigned to it on the date that
it was received into Distribution inventory and a category: Harvest, Purchase, or
Manufacture
i.Harvest: Assigned to house grown flower on the date that it is shucked from the
stalk following during.  Harvest folders will inherit the cultivation files (Planting Log
and Harvest Log) when generated.  The following records will be generated at this
time: Batch Record, Test Sample Transfer Manifest, Processing Log, and Stocking
Log.
ii.Purchase: Assigned to bulk flower purchased from another distributor on the day
that the material is received and signed for.  The following records will go into the
folder: Co A (provided by distributor), Invoice and Manifest (may be one
documents in some cases), Purchase Order, Processing Log, and Stocking Log
iii. Manufacture: Assigned to chocolates, balms, tinctures, and cartridges on the
date that they are transferred into the vault to await testing.  The following
records will go into the folder: Test Sample Transfer Manifest, Processing Log, and

### Stocking Log.

b.Record Keeping: All folders will be stored by month in the retail filing cabinet in the top
drawer.
c.Processing Work-Flow: Following the receipt of the Co A (Certificate of Analysis) for bulk
materials to be processed (either from the Testing Lab or Vendor) the bulk items will
move from Distribution Quarantine into Distribution Inventory.
i.Processing Logs: At this time the Processing Logs will be populated with the

### Starting Mass, UID, THC%, CBD%, and Check-In Date.

ii.Processing: Each Processing event will move in the following order:

### 1. The Department Manager will remove up to a pound of bulk material from

processing log, capturing the date, amount removed, and the remaining
amount.

## Page 8

MOTA Inc. Budtender / Retail Employee Manual 0 3/2 0 2 2 1 0 A
8 2.The Department Manager will generate a Weigh-Out Form with all
pertinent information populated and transfer the form and bulk material to
the processors.

### 3. Upon completing the work assigned the processors’ work will be inspected

by the on-duty manager.  This manager will sign for the material, formally
marking hand off between Distribution and Retail.

### 4. The Retail Manager/Lead, on duty, will enter the materials into Blaze POS,

the Stocking Logs, and the Processing Logs

### Note: The Stocking Logs must match Processing Logs and the Weigh-Out Form.


### If you need to stock the counter, mark it as a separate event on the Stocking

Log.

### 2. Retail Goods: all goods purchased by retail for resale at the counter.

a.For all purchased retail items the distributor will provide the Co A and Invoice.  The
receiving clerk will check the invoice against the Purchase Order and Pay-Out the vendor
accordingly.
b.All folders will be stored in the retail filing cabinet in the second from the top drawer.  The

### Co A, Purchase Order, and Invoice all go into separate folders within the month folder.


c.The Invoice will be scanned and saved on the store gdrive/Bobas and Bill/Managers/Retail

### Records/Invoices

d.Retail Stocking Log: At the time of receiving a batch the item must be entered into Blaze
POS.  If the brand exists then record the new batch in the existing Retail Stocking Log
(stored in the Vault in the Blue Folder if bin is depleted).  If it is a new brand then a new

### Retail Stocking log will be generated.

i.Documentation in Blaze POS: Name, Unit, Cost, Amount, Price, Best-By Date, and
Picture

### 3. Distribution Sales: all goods sold to other distributors – exempt from excise tax and must be

transported in a vehicle registered to a transport license.  These transactions will be handled by
the Distro Manager or higher.

## Page 9

MOTA Inc. Budtender / Retail Employee Manual 0 3/2 0 2 2 1 0 A
9 a.Each transaction between Mota Distribution and another Distributor will generate an

### Invoice (recycling Invoice may also be required) and Manifest.

b.All files will be stored by month in the Retail Filing Cabinet in the drawer third from the
top.  Within each month there are separate folders for Invoices and Manifests
c.All invoices will be scanned into the store gdrive/Bobas and Bill/Managers/Distribution
Records

### 4. Purchasing and Receiving

a.Purchase Order Generation: Retail managers are tasked with following the flow of sales
and new products via the Blaze inventory to ensure a diverse and healthy inventory to
provide patients.  Starting each Monday a Retail Manager will  begin to generate Purchase

### Orders (PO’s) in Blaze POS based on what he/she has assessed to be in need by the store.

b.Friday the PO’s confirmed for delivery will be Approved and sent to the Accountant.
c.Monday the Pay-Outs will be delivered with their associated PO’s and a table of all
expected deliveries for that day.

### Note: Vendor shipments will only be accepted on Designated Receiving days (Monday’s and


### Tuesdays) or if ‘special Arrangements’ are made. ‘Walk-in’ shipments are not to be accepted

by retail staff.
d.At time of delivery the Invoice is to be cross referenced against the PO.  If there is less
than the quantity ordered the Receiving Clerc is personally responsible for the adjustment
and reduced payout.

### Note: Do not accept anything extra, payouts cannot be expanded.

i.Manifest: Signature, Name, Date, Phone Number of the Receiving Manager and

### Time of Delivery.

ii.Invoice: Signature, Name, Date of the Vendor, Amount Paid (make sure to note
what and why if a payout is adjusted).

### Note: Photocopy the signed originals and keep them for our records.


### Note: Count the pay-out and double check the math if you adjust a payout, you are

responsible for the money.

## Page 1 0

MOTA Inc. Budtender / Retail Employee Manual 0 3/2 0 2 2 1 0 A
1 0 e.Inventory: See above for what paper records to generate.  As for Blaze POS, by completing
the PO you will move the purchased products into inventory.

### 5. Inventory Reconciliation

a.Daily Counts:
i.Morning Count: Each day a Daily Inventory Count Log needs to be generated from

### Blaze Safe Inventory.  The Counter Inventory will be added to the values listed on

the current Stocking Logs and compared to the Blaze Inventory.  If any values do
not reconcile, they will be noted on the record and reported to the Compliance

### Officer or the designated Manager immediately for follow up.

ii.Afternoon Count: At the change of shift the Till will be counted and a sales report
for the morning will generated.  IF the Till is on, only the goods sold will be
counted.  Otherwise, the entire counter must be counted.  This will be done on the
same Daily Inventory Count record used by the opening shift.
b.Weekly Counts: Once a week the Stocking Logs will be verified by a hand count of the
vault inventory.  This event will be captured on the Stocking Log as a zero sum
adjustment.  If any discrepancies are discovered they are to be: 1.) adjusted on the

### Stocking Log, Adjusted in Blaze POS, and reported to the Compliance Officer or the


### General Manager for follow-up by the end of the shift. This event will be captured the


### Vault Inventory Count Log.

c.Monthly Counts: Every 3 0 days, per Title 1 6 Division 4 2, the Blaze POS inventory must be
cross referenced against a hand count by the Retail Manager and the Compliance Officer.

### 6. Vendor Conduct

a.Vendors are second to Patients, if one comes into talk, pitch new products, train, etc. and
there are Patients not yet being helped in the lobby – tell them to wait.
b.The General Manager / purchasing clerk will only be available for vendors to meet on
designated day(s) and times, generally before noon.  If they come in any other time, they
may leave samples and in information, but tell them to come back a different time.

## Page 1 1

MOTA Inc. Budtender / Retail Employee Manual 0 3/2 0 2 2 1 0 A
1 1 c.Vendors may only deliver goods on pre-determined days, if they come any other day turn
them away and tell them when to come back in keeping with our schedule.
d.Vendors may only deliver goods in through the back door.  They may come in or leave
through the front the rest of the time.

### 7. Disciplinary Action

a.Verbal Warnings: The Retail Lead may issue a verbal warning for any deviation instead of
documenting it with a written warning.  This is meant to provide an avenue for
constructive criticism in the work place and if a verbal warning is issued, effort towards
improvement is expected
b.Written Warnings:  IF improvement is not observed the Retail Lead may issue a Written
Warning as a means of escalation.
i.1 st Warning is a formal meeting for corrective action and will be issued with a plan
forward: what’s expected of you, how to improve, and how long you have to
demonstrate improvement
ii.2 nd Warning is either a continuation of the first (improvement was not shown or
deviation was repeated) or a new deviation within 3 0 days of a 1 st Warning.  2 nd
Warnings come with a suspension of privileges, eg. participation in the monthly
recycling initiative
iii. 3 rd Warning is either a continuation of the first (improvement was not shown or
deviation was repeated) or a new deviation within 9 0 days of a 2 nd Warning.  3 rd
Warnings will continue a suspension of privilege and set the grounds for
Termination if there are any further issues within 1 8 0 days of issuance.

### 8. Errata

a.Employees are expected to Punch-In and Punch-Out prior to their scheduled shift start
using the Fingerprint Scanner located by the Posting Board to ensure accurate pay-roll,
failure to do so can result in a Warning, suspension, or termination.

### Note: It is the employee’s responsibility to confirm punch-in, The interface will greet you

with a ‘Thank You’- mis-punches are equivalent to not punching at all.
b.Employees are expected to check the Posting Board daily for information about Specials,

### Discounts, Changes to Policy, etc.

1 2 IV. Product s Training

### 1. How to grow a plant?

a.Juveniles
i.Transplant in 1 2-1 6 oz. cup with holes in the bottom
ii.Filled with organic soil, enough to submerge root plug

### Note: Do not remove from grow block, the plant will die

iii. 1 st time water in excess – overflowing
iv. 2 nd time and after water only when soil is dry

### Note: Water as needed – biggest mistake is overwatering

b.Teens are the same, but transplant into a bigger container

### Note: Leave about ¼ rooting material above soil


### Note: Do not put into direct sunlight for 2 weeks and slowly acclimate


### 2. What does sativa, hybrid, and indica mean and what terpenes are involved?

a.In the 1 8 th Century Linneaus coined the term sativa to describe hemp found in Europe and

### Eurasia grown for its seeds and fibers.  Lamarck titled hemp grown in India indica for

psychoactive traits as well as its utility.  Most cultivars today are descended from the
latter and the former has be relegated, along with vulgaris, to the industrial hemp world.
Today we loosely use sativa and indica to describe tall, thin-leafed and short, fat-leafed
plants.
b.The “indica and sativa effect” is largely dictated by the terpenes involved – we are in the
process of collecting the terpene profiles for all our flowers.  As a collective we also want
to move away from those terms and start educating our patients to the effects of the
flower as a function of the terpenes.  This is because, with the exception of medical
patients, experientially terpenes are what will dictate the consumers’ choices and we

## Page 1 3

MOTA Inc. Budtender / Retail Employee Manual 0 3/2 0 2 2 1 0 A
1 3 want them to be making informed decisions. The following are the big players you must
be familiar with:
i.Myrcene: for the most part myrcene dictates whether a strain will have an indica
or sativa effect. Strains containing over 5 0% of myrcene produce a more sedative
high (indica effect) regardless of other terpenes involved

### 1. Indica effect: linalool, terpinolene

ii.Limonene: Dominant terpene in strains with a sativa effect. Limonene aids in the
absorption of other terpenes through the skin and mucous membranes – this
means you’ll see it in topicals and sprays.  Has been used to treat anxiety and
depression.

### 1. Sativa effect: α-pinene, humulene

iii. β-Caryophyllene: The only terpene known to interact with the body’s
endocannabinoid system (CB 2). It produces anti-inflammatory and analgesic
effects.  This makes it synergistic with CBD for pain relief.
Note: the mechanism of action for terpenes is unknown

### 3. Please consider the following figures of two hybrid strains – you’ll notice that myrcene and

limonene have been expressed in comparable quantities – this has been done deliberately
through a careful breeding program.

### Note: The left axis is for the THCA and ∆-9 THC, the right axis is for everything else.

1 4 Figure 2: Terpene and Cannabiod profile of 3 1 0 1 2 0 1 9-SKY, via HS-GC-MS and HPLC-MS

### 4. Effects of different cannabinoids on the body

a.Minor cannabinoids play a role in the entourage effect as well and are especially
important to our medical users for their various uses: anti-inflammatory (systemic health),
anxiolytic (anti-anxiety), orexigenic (appetite stimulant), analgesic (pain relief), and
sedative (zzzzzz).
b.Your body has an endocannabinoid system upon which cannabinoids act.  Examples of
endocannabinoids are anandamide, 2-arachidonyl glycol (2-AG), and N-arachidonyl
dopamine (NADA).  These are signals molecules for CB 1, CB 2, and TRPV 1 receptors and
are tightly regulated by digestive enzymes.  However these enzymes don’t work well on
phytocannabinoids and so we exploit that with cannabis.  The endocannabinoid system
supports pain, anxiety, and appetite regulation systems and works well most of your life.
In the event you need to upregulate these systems for whatever reason the primary
means of control can’t be tuned without undesirable side effects, which is where we step
in.
c.CB 1 is largely expressed in the CNS while CB 2 and TRPV 1 are largely located in the
vascular tissue nerves and immune cells (fibroblasts, T-cells, macrophages).  CBD
preferentially binds to CB 2, about a 1 0:1, and so will down regulate the activities of those
systems via inflammatory, pain signal, satiety down-regulation.  CBD is deeply synergistic
with THC because THC will preferentially bind CB 1 and this will keep CBD bound longer
where it can do the most good – this works via Le’ Chatelier’s Principle of chemical action.

1 5 To a lesser extent and in their subtly nuanced ways the other minors work in a similar way
with selectivity dictated by uptake, delivery, stability, etc.

### Note: Sedative action is secondary to anxiolytic action

d.Nonpsychoactive: Cannabidiol (CBD/a/v), Cannabigerol (CBG/a), Cannabinol (CBN),

### Cannabichromene (CBC), Tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCa/v)

e.Psychoactive: ∆9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), ∆8-Tetrahydrocannabinol (∆8-THC),

### Tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCv)

f.Please see Terpene Focused Appendix -

### 5. Where do concentrates come from and what does that mean?

a.Solventless Concentrates:
i.Hash: the result of pressing the fine dust that comes off grinding flower primarily
composed of trichromes (kief)
ii.Coldwater/Bubble Hash: Using ice-cold water to separate the trichromes from the
flower material initially removes the need of grinding
iii. Rosin: the result of pressing and heating (~1 6 0C) whole buds and collecting the
extruded oil
b.Solvent Extractions:
i.Hydrocarbon Extraction: Usually butane or propane solvent is pushed through
flower using a closed-loop system.  The drawback is that the solvents might get
trapped in the extract and fail compliance.
ii.CO 2 Extraction: super-critical carbon dioxide solvent in a closed loop system.  CO 2
is tunable and so it can grab carotenoids and flavonoids, creating a more authentic
profile of extract.  The drawback is that the equipment is orders of magnitude
more expensive than BHO of PHO.

### 1. Hash Oil:  This is the extract after the solvent has been heated off


### 2. Shatter:   This is the extract after the solvent has been pumped off and the

oil has solidified into a hard, glass like material

## Page 1 6

MOTA Inc. Budtender / Retail Employee Manual 0 3/2 0 2 2 1 0 A
1 6 3.Budder/Badder:  Residual waxes and high-weight oils prevent the extract
from crystallizing into a glassy material and is caught in a soft matter state

### 4. Wax:  Enough high weight oils and waxes remain as to completely prevent

the extract from solidifying and a crumbly, gooey wax remains

### 5. Crumble:  Same material as the others except that the extract was gently

heated over a very long period of time – this makes for a quasi-dried wax
that’s crumbly in texture

### 6. Live Resin:  This is hash oil that was made from flash-frozen plant matter

that has preserved a more robust flavor profile

### 7. Et OH Extractions:  Hot ethanol is used in a Soxhlet system (cycling hot

solvent through flower using a syphon).  The problem is that you also pick
up all the waxes and chlorophyll – for this reason crude Et OH extracts are
not commonly used for anything besides feedstock for distillate
production.  The exception to this being RSO.
c.Distillation: Concentrates from any of the above processes can be improved via
distillation, but first they need to be winterized.  If your feedstock is B/PHO or CO 2
concentrate than you need to dissolve it into ethanol.
i.Winterization: The Et OH crude is cooled to -2 0 C and the waxes and high weight
oils will float to the top and be skimmed off.
ii.Decarboxylation: THCa and CBDa have boiling points that are far too high to be
distilled and so the crude is heated to about 1 0 5C and the acid group leaves as
CO 2 – you’ll note that to do this it must be in a sealed system as Et OH’s boiling
point is about 6 0 C at 1 atmosphere
iii. Short-Path Distillation/Kugelrohr: Using heat and high-vacuum the
cannabinoids are distilled over a short path condenser.  This is done in batches and
can be upgraded to a wiped-film, continuous system in industrial scale-ups, but the
chemistry is the same.

### Note: Distillation removes any accessory molecules from the concentrate – this includes

terpenes, flavonoids, carotenoids, etc. If you want to create flavored products (eg. most
carts) you have to add the terpenes back in after the fact.

1 7 d.Terpenes: Currently there are no products on the market with the carotenoids or
flavonoids added back in, and as such we will ignore them for the purpose of this
document.  Terpenes can be sourced from the cannabis (very expensive) and harvested
via steam-distillation from the flower (Clevenger Still Process) or sourced from food  in the
same way (cheaper and can claim to be organic).

### Our customers/patients are the reason why we exist. If not for the patient, we would be languishing

and toiling like so very many in today’s society. The days of the ‘Salt Mine’ would be the new norm.

### We must recognize, embrace and rise to the challenge of cultivating them as our own. We must

strive to develop nurture and create MOTA evangelists to carry our message of quality and service to
the masses! It begins with -
A. The Six Pillars of Customer Service
Attitude

### Attitude includes being solution-driven, being positive, having energy, etc.  Contrary to popular

belief, there are some very effective ways to influence these things.
Interest
Interest is being 1 0 0% customer-focused, and conveying to customers that they are important.
Action
Over 9 0% of customers consider “taking ownership” as the primary factor in WOW customer
experience.

### Verbal Language

Strong communication skills, and attention to positive verbal language  strategies create positive
experiences, and minimize negative ones.

### Body Language


### Even when our mouths aren’t speaking, our body is. Poor body language can often undermine

otherwise positive messages.

### Tone of Voice

This is the single most neglected, yet one of the most powerful skill sets. Tone of voice contributes to
our ability to persuade, influence, empathize and engage.

1 8 Each of these pillars involve very specific skill sets that you can target, and, of course, not all of the
pillars apply equally, or in every work environment.  Take the time to examine what you would like to
accomplish, then use the six pillars of customer service to guide your training or coaching initiatives.

Understand the  characteristics of an exceptional customer/patient experience in six
pillars .
- Personalization, or rather, focusing on the individual to create an emotional connection
with the customer.
- integrity, or rather, the ability to create a trusting relationship through credibility.
- Expectations, or rather, being aware of customer expectations and knowing how to exceed
them.
- Resolution,  or rather, assuming responsibility for a problem and knowing how to manage it
effectively.
- Time and effort , or rather, the ability to simplify the customer experience as much as
possible, minimizing the effort required by the customer.
- Empathy,  or rather, creating a significant relationship with customers based on the
analysis of circumstances.

B. The Champions of the Customer/Patient Experience

As an example, In the Customer Experience Excellence Center’s 2 0 1 7 classification, ranking first is
QVC (Quality, Value and Convenience) , an organization with 9 billion home purchases. QVC complies
perfectly with the six pillars:
- Personalization:  it offers a para-social relationship with an emotional connection
- Resolution:  it offers a full money back guarantee if the goods are returned within 3 0 days
- Integrity : the presenters are expert figures
- Time and effort : simple and quick payment and delivery with contactless payment options
- Empathy:  proximity to customers; there is even talk of “intimacy at a distance”
- Expectations : excellent management of expectations with the highest customer loyalty
rate in the world  (9 3%).

C. “The first step in exceeding your customer’s (patient) expectations is to know those
expectations.”   Roy Hollister Williams

1 9 It is widely accepted that exceeding customer expectations is key to customer satisfaction, delight,
and loyalty. Accordingly, it is critical for organizations to try to find out in advance what their
customers’ expectations are, because a failure to meet or exceed those expectations could lead to
dissatisfaction and defection.
Expectations are pre-experience beliefs about how a product or service will be delivered that serve as
a standard, or reference point, against which the performance of an organization will be judged.
Knowing what the customer expects is the first and possibly most critical step in delivering great
experiences.
In a world where expectations are a moving target, accurately setting and then meeting expectations
must become a core competence. Consequently, world class organizations pay attention to two
things, how expectations are formed, and then, how they meet those expectations.

### Amazon, for example, strives to ensure that they deliver products within three days. They set the

expectation and then use a range of delivery methods to exceed it. However – worst case, they meet
the expectation they have set.
When Zappos  first started trading, they had a choice, invest in advertising, or invest in the experience
and drive word of mouth. They chose the latter really wowing their customers by shipping products
by air overnight. Customer’s expectations were for a three-day delivery, in fact if they ordered before
midnight, they were likely to get their products by 8.0 0 am the following morning. Zappos  didn’t
reveal how they achieved this miracle and their customers, duly excited, told their friends and
colleagues about this amazing service, fueling the Zappos  word of mouth marketing strategy.

### Expectations can be set explicitly or implicitly. Some brands such as motoring rescue company Green


### Flag, the AAA of Britain, (we get to you within 6 0 minutes or 5 0% off your next premium) and


### Premier Inn  (a great night’s sleep or your money back) embed achieving the expectation in their

brand promise. IBIS hotels guarantee to resolve any issue you may have with the service received in
the hotel within 1 5 minutes or your stay is free. For other organizations the expectations are set
implicitly, Ritz Carlton  for example deliver on multiple small expectations knowing that cumulatively
these add up to the brand promise, “where the genuine care and comfort of our guests is our highest
mission.” In fact, at Ritz Carlton , managing each individual guest’s expectations is a science and
provides the basis for a highly personalized service to its customers.
In each hotel within the chain, a special organization exists called guest recognition. This special
function uses the CLASS database to remember over 8 0 0,0 0 0 guests and generate information for all
appropriate staff. It stores likes/dislikes; previous difficulties; family interests; personal interests;
preferred credit card; frequency of stay; lifetime usage/amount of purchase. In this way staff can
understand what is ‘new or different’ about an individual customer. Staff carry special notebooks to
capture insight on each guest and then input the information into the database. It ensures that Ritz
Carlton  can continually meet and often exceed their guest’s expectations. They call it the Ritz Carlton
mystique.

2 0 Great organizations manage both explicit and implicit expectations. They focus on how expectations
are formed and develop their strategies accordingly. They ask themselves the following questions:
- How does word of mouth shape expectations?
- What are the explicit and overt promises or commitments that we can make to our
customers?
- What are the small ways in which we set expectations day to day? Do we set
expectations accurately?
- What are the intensifiers – those things that load our customer’s expectations with
emotion  (e.g. a customer who rushes into Home Depot for materials to fix a burst water
pipe has a set of heightened expectations which will not be present when he returns two
weeks later to look at garden furniture).
- Who is setting our customer’s expectations for service? What do we need to do to
respond?

### Not all expectations are equal. Organizations have choices about the expectations they meet, the

expectations they exceed and how they might delight the customer. In many instances, a customer
will have a range within which their expectations can be met. For example, when waiting for a phone
to be answered some customers will be willing to wait for 6 0 seconds and their satisfaction will not
change if the phone is answered within 1 2 0 seconds.
This is known as the zone of tolerance and is vital for planning response
times and optimizing resources The Science

### Our brains love expectations! As human beings we are programmed to be continually predicting the

future. It is what keeps us safe. We expect a sabre tooth tiger to act in a certain way, a wasp to sting
us and an axe wielding madman to present a particular danger.

### Expectations are how we make sense of the world and understand what will happen next. Daniel

Kahneman describes how our brains have two systems which view the world through our network of
expectations. System one is our monitoring system, it enables us to operate on automatic for much
of the time. If everything meets our expectations. We can do things without unconsciously thinking
about them. However, when our expectations are not met; system two is activated which brings the
failure to meet the expectation to our explicit attention. It activates our emotions and we become
fearful if we can no longer accurately predict what will happen next.

### Consequently, we like it when things happen the way that we expect them to. We like it even more

when we’re not sure that things will happen the way that we expect, and they happen that way
anyway. We particularly like it when our expectations are exceeded in a pleasurable way.
Therefore expectations are such a vital part of customer experience.

2 1 The Golden Rules
Set my expectations accurately
AMAZON  is a good example of an organization that manages expectations very skillfully. As long as
you order before 7:0 0 pm at night they will deliver the following day often by 8:3 0 AM. Their approach
to expectation management is carefully orchestrated. Setting and meeting the logistical expectations
of the customer is the first step, the way in which they deal with the customer, the care they take,
the ease, the friendliness of their people and purchase selection then exceeds expectations leading
to a delighted customer.
Agree timings with me
Being clear on the plan and what the customer needs to do is vital to successful expectation
management.
AMAZON has been successful because they are absolutely clear on timing and requirements of the
customer.
Being able to set a convenient time is a key first step to fulfilling the patients’ needs.
Respond more quickly than I anticipate
A rapid response to questions, issues or complaints is what customers have come to expect. They
think that the company  should see the situation from their perspective and act accordingly. Rapid
response is a hygiene factor rather than a delight factor. It provides reassurance that the company
takes the situation seriously.

### Use plain English – no jargon


### The language used is also very important. Vague promises lead to frustration. Clear promises and

execution establish the ground rules from the outset. Customers have become adept at spotting
obfuscation and hidden get outs.
Fulfill or exceed your promises

### Failing to meet an overt promise is worse than not making a promise at all. Overcoming a failure to

meet an expectation by then exceeding the expectation should not be a strategy. It should purely be
a measure of last resort.

### Guide Me Through the Process

By guiding the customer carefully through the process expectations can be accurately set and then
delivered against. Customers often have no idea how long it might take to meet their objective. A
process that sets expectations ensures the organization is not caught out.

2 2 II. Components of the Customer Experience

#1 Customer Focused Culture  – who is in customer service in your business?

For your people to deliver a truly exceptional experience for your customers you must actively build
and create a culture and environment where the customer is the epicenter of how the entire
business thinks, feels and acts. ‘Customer Service’ shouldn’t just be a department, it should be the
whole business.


### As Sir Richard Branson, founder of Virgin, puts it . . .


“Customers do not come first, employees come  first. If you take care of your
employees, they will take care of your customers.”

Think of this strategy as your customer value chain. You are only as strong as your weakest link!  An
internal culture of not returning calls or taking ownership or being late or being sloppy will manifest
itself into your external culture, with your customers.

#2 Service Experience Design – how easy are WE to do business with?

Service experience design is the mechanism for you and your business to design, build and focus on
creating optimum service experiences. This requires a holistic view of your entire business and
exploring every touch point that customers have with your business ensuring they are joined up,
memorable and create true market leading differentiation.

Great businesses design and build their entire value proposition, systems and processes around the
customer and frequently ask questions like ‘ How easy are we to do business with?’

#3 Service Experience Delivery  – are you consistently delivering on your promises?


### Service experience design (#2) is only 5 0% of a double-edged sword.  The other 5 0% is centered on

your healthy obsession and unwavering focus on delivering consistent, flawless customer
experiences through a discipline of ‘disciplined execution’.

2 3 The Carl W. Buehner quote comes to mind:

“They may forget what you said – but they will never forget how you made them
feel”.

It is our long-term commitment to creating, fostering, and consistently delivering a world class
customer experience.

#4 Customer Satisfaction – are your customers satisfied or ‘VERY’  satisfied?

Customers of every walk of life regularly tell family, friends and colleagues when they have received a
great customer experience, BUT they tell 3 X more people when they have a bad experience.
