# Request for Blaze API Sandbox Base URL and Swagger Documentation

Subject: Request for Blaze API Sandbox Base URL and Swagger Documentation

Hi Blaze Integrations Team,

We’re integrating with the Blaze Developer API and believe our current credentials are for a sandbox/non-production environment. Could you please help with sandbox discovery?

Specifically, we’re looking for:
- Sandbox base URL(s) for REST v1 (and GraphQL, if applicable)
- Sandbox OpenAPI/Swagger documentation URL
- Confirmation of required auth headers in sandbox (we’re using `partner_key` and `Authorization`)
- Any environment-specific differences vs. production

For reference (masked):
- Partner Key: 32-char hex ending e8d398e7
- Authorization (Dispensary) Key: 32-char hex ending 66285925
- Secret: not included for security; can provide last 6–8 if needed

We reviewed the production swagger at `api.partners.blaze.me` and saw environment enums (Development/UAT/Beta/Production), but we couldn’t find an official sandbox host or swagger URL. If sandbox requires separate credentials or activation, please advise the process (we can provide company/shop/location IDs as needed).

Thank you for your help!
