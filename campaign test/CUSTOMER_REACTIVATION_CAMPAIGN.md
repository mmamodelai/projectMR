## 💡 **CAMPAIGN STRATEGY**

### **Core Principles:**

1. **Tiered Approach**: Different messages and offers based on:
   - Customer tier (Super VIP > VIP > Regular)
   - Days inactive (30-60d → 120-180d)
   
2. **Escalating Incentives**: The longer they've been gone, the bigger the offer

3. **Personalization**: Use their name, reference past purchases, create urgency

4. **Test & Learn**: A/B test messages, track response rates, iterate

5. **Multi-Touch**: SMS → Email → Phone call (for Super VIPs)

## 🎯 **POST-CAMPAIGN STRATEGY**

### **If Customer Returns:**
1. **Welcome them back warmly** - make them feel missed
2. **Ask for feedback**: "What brought you back?"
3. **Capture email/phone** if missing
4. **Offer loyalty reward**: "Visit 3 more times this month, get X"
5. **Set follow-up reminder**: Text them in 2 weeks

### **If Customer Doesn't Respond:**
- **Wait 90 days**, then try one final "We're removing you" message
- **Remove from active marketing** after 180 days total
- **Archive customer** but keep in database for future win-backs

### **Ongoing Retention Program:**
- **30-day check-in**: If customer hasn't visited in 30 days, send friendly reminder
- **Birthday/Anniversary**: Special offers on customer milestones
- **Loyalty tiers**: Make it clear what perks each tier gets
- **VIP exclusives**: Early access to new products, private events

## 💡 **OPTIMIZATION TIPS**

### **A/B Testing Ideas:**
1. **Emoji vs. No Emoji** in messages
2. **Discount % vs. Free Product** offers
3. **Urgency** ("48 hours" vs. "This weekend")
4. **Personal** ("We miss you") vs. **Transactional** ("Here's an offer")
5. **Send time**: Tuesday 11am vs. Friday 2pm vs. Saturday 12pm

### **Personalization Enhancements:**
- Reference their **favorite strain** (from purchase history)
- Mention **last product purchased**
- Show **lifetime value** (for VIPs: "You've spent $X with us!")
- **Days since last visit** (create urgency)
- **Budtender name** if they always saw the same person

### **Offer Optimization:**
- **Test discount levels**: 10% vs. 15% vs. 20%
- **Test free products**: Pre-roll vs. 1/8th vs. Vape
- **Test exclusivity**: "VIP-only offer" vs. generic
- **Test scarcity**: "Limited to first 50" vs. open-ended

## 🚀 **SUCCESS STORIES (Hypothetical)**

### **Example 1: Super VIP Recovery**
*"John was a Super VIP who hadn't visited in 72 days. We sent him the Wave 2 message with 15% off + free 1/8th. He responded within 2 hours, visited that weekend, spent $147, and has been back twice since. Total recovered value: $441 over 60 days."*

### **Example 2: VIP Phone Call**
*"Sarah was a VIP who hadn't responded to 2 SMS messages. We called her personally, discovered she'd been traveling for work. She appreciated the personal touch, came back the next day, and referred a friend. Value recovered: $328 + $89 referral."*

### **Example 3: Dormant to Active**
*"Mike was dormant for 85 days. The 15% off message brought him back. He mentioned he'd been going to a competitor but our personal outreach reminded him why he loved MOTA. Now he's back to weekly visits."*
