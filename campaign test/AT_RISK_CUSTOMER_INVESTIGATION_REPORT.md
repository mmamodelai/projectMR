## 🔬 **DEEP INSIGHTS**

### **Why Are They Leaving?**

**Hypothesis Based on Data:**
1. **Budtender Turnover**: Some customers' primary budtender may have left/changed schedule
2. **Competition**: New dispensary opened nearby?
3. **Price Sensitivity**: Prices increased?
4. **Product Selection**: Not finding what they want?
5. **Inconvenience**: Parking/hours/location issues?

**Next Steps**: Add "Why did you stop visiting?" survey for responders

---

### **Budtender Relationship Patterns:**

**Strong Relationships (likely to respond to budtender mention):**
- Bob McGinn customers: 89 primary relationships, $892 avg LTV
- Jacob Vangellow customers: 76 primary relationships, $831 avg LTV
- Jimmy Silks customers: 98 primary relationships, $774 avg LTV

**Weaker Relationships:**
- Luis Bobadilla customers: Only 19 primary relationships
